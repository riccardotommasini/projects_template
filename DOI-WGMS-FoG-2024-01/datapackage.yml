      description: |-
        The name of the glacier, written in capital letters (A-Z).

        In order to ensure global interoperability of our dataset, glacier names should only contain the following characters: A-Z (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z), 0-9 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), - (dash), . (period), : (colon), () (parentheses), / (forward slash), ' (apostrophe), and  (space). Characters which do not fall into the given range should be transliterated. If no Latin name exists, use the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards for transliteration (https://www.iso.org/ics/01.140.10/x/). If the Latin name contains accents, apply the following rules (Å → AA, Æ → AE, Ä → AE, ð → D, Ø → OE, œ → OE, Ö → OE, ß → SS, þ → TH, Ü → UE) and neglect any remaining accents.

        If a name is too long, a meaningful abbreviation should be used. In this case, the full name should be listed in `REMARKS`.

        Glacier primary classification per [*Perennial ice and snow masses* (UNESCO/IAHS, 1970)](https://www.wgms.ch/downloads/UNESCO_1970.pdf):

          - 0 (Other): Any type not listed below (please explain in `REMARKS`).
          - 1 (Continental ice sheet): Inundates areas of continental size.
          - 2 (Icefield): Ice masses of sheet or blanket type of a thickness that is insufficient to obscure the subsurface topography.
          - 3 (Ice cap): Dome-shaped ice masses with radial flow.
          - 4 (Outlet glacier): Drains an ice sheet, icefield or ice cap, usually of valley glacier form. The catchment area may not be easily defined.
          - 5 (Valley glacier): Flows down a valley. The catchment area is well defined.
          - 6 (Mountain glacier): Cirque, niche or crater type, hanging glacier. Includes ice aprons and groups of small units.
          - 7 (Glacieret and snowfield): Small ice masses of indefinite shape in hollows, river beds and on protected slopes, which has developed from snow drifting, avalanching, and/or particularly heavy accumulation in certain years. Usually no marked flow pattern is visible. In existence for at least two consecutive years.
          - 8 (Ice shelf): Floating ice sheet of considerable thickness attached to a coast nourished by a glacier(s). Snow accumulation on its surface or bottom freezing.
          - 9 (Rock glacier): Lava-stream-like debris mass containing ice in several possible forms and moving slowly downslope.

        Note: `PARENT_GLACIER` can be used to classify complex glacier systems – for example, ice caps with outlet glaciers and glaciers splitting into multiple glaciers over time.

          - 0 (Other): Any type not listed below (please explain in `REMARKS`).
          - 1 (Compound basins): Two or more individual valley glaciers issuing from tributary valleys and coalescing (Fig. 1a).
          - 2 (Compound basin): Two or more individual accumulation basins feeding one glacier system (Fig. 1b).
          - 3 (Simple basin): Single accumulation area (Fig. 1c).
          - 4 (Cirque): Occupies a separate, rounded, steep-walled recess which it has formed on a mountain side (Fig. 1d).
          - 5 (Niche): Small glacier in a V-shaped gulley or depression on a mountain slope (Fig. 1e). More common than a further-developed cirque glacier.
          - 6 (Crater): Occurring in extinct or dormant volcanic craters.
          - 7 (Ice apron): Irregular, usually thin ice mass which adheres to a mountain slope or ridge.
          - 8 (Group): A number of similar ice masses occurring in close proximity and too small to be assessed individually.
          - 9 (Remnant): Inactive, usually small ice masses left by a receding glacier.

          - 1 (Piedmont): Icefield formed on a lowland area by lateral expansion of one or a coalescence of several glaciers (Fig. 2a, 2b).
          - 2 (Expanded foot): Lobe or fan formed where the lower portion of the glacier leaves the confining wall of a valley and extends onto a less restrictive and more level surface (Fig. 2c).
          - 3 (Lobed): Ice sheet or ice cap outlet glacier lacking a calving terminus (Fig. 2d).
          - 4 (Calving): Terminus of a glacier sufficiently extended into sea or lake water to produce icebergs. Includes - for this inventory - dry land calving which would be recognisable from the “lowest glacier elevation".
